## Given problem

Decorator pattern can help reduce a profusion of subclasses by adding additional responsibilities at runtime instead of compile time.

Imagine we run a car dealership, we sell various models of cars:
- Economy
- Luxury
- Sport

With many kinds of options:
- Engine size: 4 or 6 cylinders
- Paint color: white, red or black
- Upholstery: leather or vinyl

The cost depends on the model and options.
